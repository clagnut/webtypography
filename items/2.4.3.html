<p>This guideline can be achieved easily when hyphenating manually. See <a href="/2.4.1" title="At hyphenated line-ends, leave at least two characters behind and take at least three forward">&sect;2.4.1</a> for more information on manual&nbsp;hypenation.</p>

	<h2>The&nbsp;Future</h2>

	<p>Hyphenation will be included in the <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/css3-text/#hyphenate"><abbr title="Cascading Style Sheets">CSS</abbr> 3 Text module</a>, but at the time of writing, the definition of the hyphenation feature is still very much up-in-the-air. Currently the <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/2007/WD-css3-gcpm-20070205/#hyphenation"><abbr title="Cascading Style Sheets">CSS</abbr> 3 Paged Media module</a> has more details of the hyphenation properties originally proposed, and among these is the <code>hyphenate-lines</code> property which specifies the maximum number of successive hyphenated lines in an element. For&nbsp;example:</p>

<pre><code>p {
  hyphenate: auto;
  hyphenate-lines: 3;
}</code></pre>

	<p>A value of <code>none</code> means that there is no limit to the number of successive hyphenated&nbsp;lines.</p>
